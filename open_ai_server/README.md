# The server side

## To run
1. Sign up for an api key at http://openai.com
2. Put that key in a `.env` file


## Putting your key in a .env file
Create a file called .env and make it look like this:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<Put your API KEY here>
```
Important: No white space at all on this line, especially around the `=` sign!
